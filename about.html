                <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Hey there! I'm Erika. A mother of four amazing children, married to my very best friend, a perpetual optimist 
                        and a photographer in Susquehanna, PA. I specialize in portrait photography.<br><br> I am humbled every year by the 
                        wonderful people who invite me to document their lives! I have proclaimed for almost a decade that I have 
                        the "Best job EVER!" and I stand by that- I am smitten with my profession, truly. I enjoy all types of 
                        sessions from newborns, families, seniors, couples, engagements and boudoir- they all bring me a unique 
                        challenge and so much reward. <br><br>When I'm not behind the camera you can find me volunteering somewhere in 
                        the community, cheering on one of my kids in their activities or spending way too much money at Homegoods! 
                        As my kids get older I've been enjoying having more time to dream up new ideas for fun sets and mini 
                        session events. I look forward to working with you!</p>

                    going to bore you- but if you're a gear junkie like me and want to hear more about my favorite gear keep reading!

                                    I can't help it... I'm just not ready to move on to mirrorless, so me and my beast power on together. 
                                    I've been through a few of these bodies but I keep buying them! I love them for the dual card slots, 
                                    the peace of mind that comes with recording to two cards at once helps me sleep better every night!

                                    This lens is my go to for 90% of outdoor photography- it's got just the right length 
                                    for me to create that magic bokeh but close enough for subjects to hear me without 
                                    me yelling! It's so sharp, it's definitely my favorite piece of glass!

                                    <h2>Sigma 35mm 1.4 Art series</h2>
                                    If I'm working with a newborn there's 99.99999% chance this is the lens I'm using 
                                    during 80% of their session! This lens is just the right focal length to grab the 
                                    whole setup while still making sure the littlest details are sharp. I want my 
                                    clients to see their little princess snoozing in that carriage but also be able 
                                    to count in eyelash in the same shot. The Sigma Art series is worth every penny!

                                    <h2>Canon 200mm 2.0</h2>
                                    The big boy. The mega lens. The legend. I swooned over this lens for entirely way 
                                    too long. I finally gave in to temptation and added it to my collection. It's 
                                    magic, like pure buttery magic. The bokeh is unparalleled; however, it weighs like 
                                    382 pounds so while I love it, I only use it once in awhile in quiet locations. 
                                    It's a really long lens so you need to be pretty far from your subject and it gets 
                                    hard to pose and prompt so far away. I really should use it more, it's truly 
                                    dreamy, but I struggle with finding perfect opportunities to use this beast.

                                    This is the little engine that could. Once upon a time I bought a bag of lenses at 
                                    a flea market for $75 and this lens was inside. It launched my whole career. It was 
                                    worth $1000 and it was a seriously gorgeous piece of glass that I just kind of lucked 
                                    into owning right when I was starting out. It desperately needs to be replaced with 
                                    a newer version- the one I have is from the 90's!
